# CS367-Game-Playing-
This program is the fifth assignment of CS367 at UW-Madison. It uses a directed graph to build a maze playing game. TheGame.java is the main class of the program. The skeleton and sample files are provided by James Skentny and the program is implemented by Han Jiang and You Wu. Have fun!
